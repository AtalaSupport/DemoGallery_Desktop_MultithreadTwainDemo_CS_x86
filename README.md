# Multithread TWAIN Demo

This is an example of setting up TWAIN scanning to work with a Multi Threaded application.

This is the C# version. We also have a [VB.NET version](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_MultithreadTwainDemo_VB_x86) available.  

NOTE that there is no x64 version. This is due to most TWAIN drivers being native 32 bit.

Please see [FAQ: Common Problems with x64 TWAIN Scanning](https://www.atalasoft.com/kb2/KB/50140/FAQ-Common-Problems-with-x64-TWAIN-Scanning)


## Licensing
This application requires a license for DotImage Document Imaging as it is making use our WinForms ThumbnailView and WorkspaceViewer in addition to DotTwain.


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2019. We use this older Visual Studio as it's the last version that ran natively in x86 for 32 bit compatibility "out of the box". As noted above, the choice to use x86 in TWAIN scanning applications is deliberate as many scanner drivers are not native 64 bit. This gives a wider scanner comptaiblity.

### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.

- Take note of each of the references we've included:
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.Lib.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.WinControls.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotTwain.dll
    - Atalasoft.Shared.dll
- Remove those referneces
- Open the NuGet Package Manger from `Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for this Solution`
- Browse for and install  Atalasoft.DotImage.WinControls.x86. It will pull in DotImage Document Imaging (the base SDK) and our windows controls and shared dll
- Browse for and install Atalasoft.DotTwain.x86. It will pull in the needed DotTwain component.
